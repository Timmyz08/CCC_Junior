# [Speed fines are not fine!](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc12J1)
***Problem Description***
Many communities now have “radar” signs that tell drivers what their speed is, in the hope that
they will slow down.
You will output a message for a “radar” sign. The message will display information to a driver
based on his/her speed according to the following table:


km/h over the limit
| km/h over the limit  | Fine  | 
|---|---|
|  1 to 20 | $ 100  |
| 21 to 30 $  |$ 270   |
|  31 or above | $ 500  |

***Input Specification***

The user will be prompted to enter two integers. First, the user will be prompted to enter the speed
limit. Second, the user will be prompted to enter the recorded speed of the car

***Output Specification***

If the driver is not speeding, the output should be:

**Congratulations, you are within the speed limit!**

If the driver is speeding, the output should be:

**You are speeding and your fine is $F.**

where F is the amount of the fine as described in the table above.
