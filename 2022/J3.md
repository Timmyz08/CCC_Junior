# Harp Tuning

**Problem Description**

The CCC harp is a stringed instrument with strings labelled
`A, B, . . . , T`. Like other instruments, it can be out of tune.
A musically inclined computer science student has written
a clever computer program to help tune the harp. The
program analyzes the sounds produced by the harp and
provides instructions to fix each string that is out of tune.
Each instruction includes a group of strings, whether they
should be tightened or loosened, and by how many turns.
Unfortunately, the output of the program is not very user
friendly. It outputs all the tuning instructions on a single
line. For example, the single line `AFB+8HC-4` actually contains two tuning instructions: `AFB+8` and `HC-4`. The first
instruction indicates that harp strings A, F, and B should
be tightened 8 turns, and the second instruction indicates
that harp strings H and C should be loosened 4 turns.
Your job is to take a single line of tuning instructions and make them easier to read


**Input Specification**

There will be one line of input which is a sequence of tuning instructions. 

Each tuning
instruction will be a sequence of uppercase letters, followed by a plus sign (+) or minus
sign (-), followed by a positive integer. There will be at least one instruction and at least
one letter per instruction. Also, each uppercase letter will appear at most once.

**Output Specification**

There will be one line of output for each tuning instruction. Each line of output will consist of
three parts, each separated by a single space: the uppercase letters referring to the strings,
tighten if the instruction contained a plus sign or loosen if the instruction contained a
minus sign, and the number of turns.

**Sample Input 1**
```
AFB+8HC-4
```
**Output for Sample Input 1**
```
AFB tighten 8
HC loosen 4
```
**Explanation of Sample Output 1**

The input contains two tuning instructions: AFB+8 and HC-4.

**Sample Input 2**
```
AFB+8SC-4H-2GDPE+9
```
**Output for Sample Input 2**
```
AFB tighten 8
SC loosen 4
H loosen 2
GDPE tighten 9
```
**Explanation of Sample Output 2**

The input contains four tuning instructions: AFB+8, SC-4, H-2, and GDPE+9.
