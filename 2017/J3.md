# Exactly Electrical

***Problem Description***

You live in Grid City, which is composed of integer-numbered streets which run east-west (parallel
to the x-axis) and integer-numbered avenues which run north-south (parallel to the y-axis). The
streets and avenues have infinite length, and there is a street for every integer y-coordinate and
an avenue for every x-coordinate. All intersections are labelled by their integer coordinates: for
example, avenue 7 and street -3 intersect at (7,-3).

You drive a special electric car which uses up one unit of electrical charge moving between adjacent
intersections: that is, moving either north or south to the next street, or moving east or west to the
next avenue). Until your battery runs out, at each intersection, your car can turn left, turn right,
go straight through, or make a U-turn. You may visit the same intersection multiple times on the
same trip.

Suppose you know your starting intersection, your destination intersection and the number of units
of electrical charge in your battery. Determine whether you can travel from the starting intersection
to the destination intersection using the charge available to you in such a way that your battery is
empty when you reach your destination.

***Input Specification***

The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a followed by b, indicating the starting
coordinate (a, b) (−1000 ≤a ≤1000; −1000 ≤b ≤1000).

The second line contains c followed by d, indicating the destination coordinate (c, d) (−1000 ≤
c ≤1000; −1000 ≤d ≤1000).

The third line contains an integer t (0 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) indicating the initial number of units of
electrical charge of your battery.


***Output Specification***

Output Y if it is possible to move from the starting coordinate to the destination coordinate using
exactly t units of electrical charge. Otherwise output N.

**Explanation for Output for Sample Input 2**

It is possible to get from (10, 2) to (10, 4) using exactly 2 units of electricity, by going north 2
units.

It is also possible to travel using 4 units of electricity as in the following sequence:
(10, 2) →(10, 3) →(11, 3) →(11, 4) →(10, 4).

It is also possible to travel using 5 units of electricity from (10, 2) to (11, 4) by the following
sequence:

(10, 2) →(10, 3) →(11, 3) →(12, 3) →(12, 4) →(11, 4).

It is not possible to move via any path of length 5 from (10, 2) to (10, 4), however.
