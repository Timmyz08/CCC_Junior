# [Happy or Sad](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc15j2)
***Problem Description***

We often include emoticons in our text messages to indicate how we are feeling. The three consecutive characters ```:-)``` indicate a happy face and the three consecutive characters ```:-(``` indicate a
sad face. Write a program to determine the overall mood of a message.

***Input Specification***

There will be one line of input that contains between 1 and 255 characters.

***Output Specification***

The output is determined by the following rules:
* If the input line does not contain any happy or sad emoticons, output none.
* Otherwise, if the input line contains an equal number of happy and sad emoticons, output
unsure.
* Otherwise, if the input line contains more happy than sad emoticons, output happy.
* Otherwise, if the input line contains more sad than happy emoticons, output sad.
