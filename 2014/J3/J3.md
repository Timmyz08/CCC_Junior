# Double Dice

### Problem Description

Antonia and David are playing a game.

Each player starts with 100 points.

The game uses standard six-sided dice and is played in rounds. During one round, each player
rolls one die. The player with the lower roll loses the number of points shown on the higher die. If
both players roll the same number, no points are lost by either player.

Write a program to determine the final scores.

### Input Specification

The first line of input contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 15), which is the number of rounds that
will be played. On each of the next n lines, will be two integers: the roll of Antonia for that round,
followed by a space, followed by the roll of David for that round. Each roll will be an integer
between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

### Output Specification

The output will consist of two lines. On the first line, output the number of points that Antonia has
after all rounds have been played. On the second line, output the number of points that David has
after all rounds have been played.

**Sample Input**

```
4
5 6
6 6
4 3

```

**Output for Sample Input**

**Explanation of Output for Sample Input**

After the first round, David wins, so Antonia loses 6 points. After the second round, there is a
tie and no points are lost. After the third round, Antonia wins, so David loses 4 points. After the
fourth round, Antonia wins, so David loses 5 points. In total, Antonia has lost 6 points and David
has lost 9 points.
