# Are we there yet?

**Problem Description**

You decide to go for a very long drive on a very straight road. Along this road are five cities. As you travel, you record the distance between each pair of consecutive cities.
You would like to calculate a distance table that indicates the distance between any two of the cities you have encountered.

**Input Specification**
The first line contains 4 positive integers less than 1000, each representing the distances between consecutive pairs of consecutive cities: specifically, the ith integer represents the distance between city `i` and city `i + 1`.

**Output Specification**

The output should be 5 lines, with the ith line (1 ≤ i ≤ 5) containing the distance from city `i` to cities `1, 2, ... 5` in order, separated by one space.

**Sample Input**

```
3 10 12 5
```
**Output for Sample Input**
```
0 3 13 25 30
3 0 10 22 27
13 10 0 12 17
25 22 12 0 5
30 27 17 5 0
```

**Explanation of Output for Sample Input**

The first line of output contains:
- 0, since the distance from city 1 to city 1 is 0;
- 3, since the distance between city 1 and city 2 is 3;
- 13, since the distance between city 1 and city 3 is 3 + 10 = 13;
- 25, since the distance between city 1 and city 4 is 3 + 10 + 12 = 25;
- 30, since the distance between city 1 and city 5 is 3 + 10 + 12 + 5 = 30.
