# Cyclic Shifts

**Problem Description**

Thuc likes finding cyclic shifts of strings. A cyclic shift of a string is obtained by moving characters
from the beginning of the string to the end of the string. We also consider a string to be a cyclic
shift of itself. For example, the cyclic shifts of `ABCDE` are:
`ABCDE`, `BCDEA`, `CDEAB`, `DEABC`, and `EABCD`.
Given some text, `T`, and a string, `S`, determine if `T` contains a cyclic shift of `S`.

**Input Specification**

The input will consist of exactly two lines containing only uppercase letters. The first line will be the text `T`, and the second line will be the string `S`. Each line will contain at most 1000 characters.


**Output Specification**

Output yes if the text, `T`, contains a cyclic shift of the string, `S`. Otherwise, output `no`.

**Sample Input 1**

```
ABCCDEABAA
ABCDE
```

**Output for Sample Input 1**

```
yes
```

**Explanation of Output for Sample Input 1**

CDEAB is a cyclic shift of ABCDE and it is contained in the text ABCCDEABAA.

**Sample Input 2**
```
ABCDDEBCAB
ABA
```

**Output for Sample Input 2**
```
no
```

**Explanation of Output for Sample Input 2**

The cyclic shifts of ABA are ABA, BAA, and AAB. None of these shifts are contained in the text
ABCDDEBCAB.
